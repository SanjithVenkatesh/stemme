# Stemme
A python library for running different elections using the dHondt, MMP, and STV voting methods. 

## Current Abilities
Be able to create an dHondt, STV, or MMP election object and use the methods defined to run an election.

Sample pytest files are also available to show examples on how they are to be used.

The Gallagher's Index has also been coded in to show how fair an election is.

## TODO
Work on creating plots for each of the election types, showing how the methods work. Looking into matplotlib for animations.

## Backburner
Start looking into Tensorflow as a way of predicting future votes for all three methods
