# VotingMethods
Various python files looking at different voting methods from SVP to MMP to d'Hondt

## Current Abilities
Create objects for the d'Hondt method and be able to calculate the winners based on the seats inputed.
For STV and MMP, you can get the actual candidates who will be elected (more important for MMP)

## TODO
Create classes for STV and MMP and additional tests to take in CSV files as an input
Get databases running as a way to track previous elections and votes

## Backburner
Start looking into Tensorflow as a way of predicting future votes for all three methods
